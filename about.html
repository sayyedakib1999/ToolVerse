                    <h3>🤔 What inspired ToolVerse?</h3>
                    <p>I was drowning in tabs. Tool 1 in a Tweet. Tool 2 in a newsletter I never read. Tool 3? No idea. Might have been a dream. So I did what every slightly overwhelmed digital explorer does... 👉 Built a thing.</p>
                    
                    <h3>🛠️ What is ToolVerse?</h3>
                    <p>ToolVerse is a lovingly crafted, alphabetically organized, no-fluff directory of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🤖 AI Tools (For writing, designing, coding, and pretending you're super productive)</li>
                        <li>🧩 No-Code Tools (For people who say "I can't code" but still build 3 startups before breakfast)</li>
                        <li>🧙‍♂️ Low-Code Tools (A little code, a lot of magic)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It's like your bookmarks folder, but way cleaner. And it doesn't judge you for having 47 open tabs and a Chrome meltdown.</p>
                    
                    <h3>🔍 What does it do? (besides looking pretty)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Live Search 🧠 Find tools in milliseconds. Just start typing and boom – it's there. Like magic. But real.</li>
                        <li>Category Filter 📂 Writing? Automation? Image Gen? Click, filter, and feel organized for once.</li>
                        <li>A to Z Sorting 🔤 Your tools are now alphabetically arranged like a nerdy library. (Your brain: "Finally, peace.")</li>
                        <li>#Tool Cards 📇 Clean. Clickable. Categorized. If only your laundry was this sorted.</li>
                        <li>No Login Needed 🙅 Because "Sign up to see more" is so 2013. Ain't nobody got time for that.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>🌍 Who is ToolVerse for?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>👨‍💻 Developers who love AI but hate chaos.</li>
                        <li>🧠 Indie hackers with 14 projects and 2 hours of sleep.</li>
                        <li>🧚‍♀️ No-coders creating magic with zero semicolons.</li>
                        <li>🐿️ Curious squirrels (like me) chasing shiny tools every day.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>🔧 Built with:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vanilla HTML, CSS & JS (yes, real vanilla – no frameworks were harmed)</li>
                        <li>Brain cells that survived caffeine abuse ☕</li>
                        <li>A dream: to never lose a tool again.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>😂 Bonus Humor Feature (aka the "Why?")</h3>
                    <p>ToolVerse doesn't just show you tools. It rescues you from:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Scavenger hunts across Twitter threads</li>
                        <li>Endless "best tools" YouTube videos</li>
                        <li>That guy on Reddit who never shares the actual link</li>
                    </ul>
